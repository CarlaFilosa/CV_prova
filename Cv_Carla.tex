\section{Other information}

\subsection{Communication skills}
I am a communicative person, and I trained myself taking part in workshops and courses and simply presenting my job in several occasions. In fact during my Ph.D. I presented my research in several internal meetings at the Central Institute of Mental Health and in conferences as well.
In those occasions the audience was mixed: ranging from neuroscientsts to psychiatrists to computational modellers, hence I learned how to explain specific contents of the project to people from different backgrounds.\\
%\subsection{Description of my Ph.D. project}
%During the learning the brain get modified in terms of his functional activity to learn and solve a new task. In this process a big role is played by the so called reward prediction error coding, namely the ability of the brain to compute differences between expected and received outcomes: one of the most fascinating and mysterious coding ability of the brain.
%The purpose of this project is to understand and explain features of neurons and neuronal ensembles during a learning task, with a particular focus on brain regions interactions assumed to be able to compute the reward prediction error, based on theory of reinforcement learning model.

\subsection{Other interests} 
Since I was a child I have been loving to dance and sport in general. I have studied ballet and rhythmic gymnastics at competitive level for many years. I have taken part in National level competitions in both Rhythmic Gymnastic and Track and Field. Currently I still dance ballet and tango at amateur lever. The beauty of the nature of regions neighboring Mannheim has meant that since I arrived in Germany MTB has become one of my favourite hobbies.

\subsection{Volunteering Experiences}
Volunteer in Hospitals, Nursing Homes and Shelter Houses in Rome.
